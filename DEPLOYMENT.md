# 🚀 Deployment Guide

This guide will help you make your portfolio website live on the internet! 

## Recommended Method: Vercel (Easiest)

Vercel is the easiest way to host a React/Vite project. It's fast, free, and automatically updates whenever you push code to GitHub.

### Step 1: Push your code to GitHub
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and create a new repository (e.g., `my-ai-portfolio`).
2. Follow the instructions to push your local code:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/saqib-niaxi/saqibniazi.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Step 2: Connect to Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/) and sign up with your GitHub account.
2. Click **"New Project"**.
3. Import your repository (`saqibniazi`).
4. Click **"Deploy"**.

**Your site will be live in less than 2 minutes!** 🎊

## Alternative Method: Netlify

Netlify is another excellent free option.

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/) and sign up.
2. Click **"Add new site"** -> **"Import an existing project"**.
3. Select **GitHub** and authorize.
4. Pick your repository.
5. Click **"Deploy site"**.

## Custom Domain (Optional)
If you own a domain (like `muhammadsaqib.com`), both Vercel and Netlify make it very easy to connect it under the **"Settings > Domains"** tab of your project.
